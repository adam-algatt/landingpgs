            The 2023 Mustang Mach-E offers a potent mix in the quickly expanding
            EV industry. The all-electric SUV won praise for combining thrilling
            performance, eye-catching appearance, cutting-edge technology, a
            joyful driving experience, and something the rival brands can't
            match: the heritage of the Mustang name. Midway through 2023, the
            Mustang Mach-E switched to a new standard-range battery with 72 kWh
            (instead of the earlier model's 70 kWh). Let's examine how the
            Mustang MachE fares in comparison to its main all-electric SUV
            rivals. The IIHS Top Safety Pick award for 2022 goes to the Mach-E.
            Ford BlueCruise 1.3 is now included as standard.

            The Build & Price website for the all-electric Ioniq 5 states that
            it is only offered in a few units. Despite its restricted
            availability, Ioniq 5 has received favorable reviews. On a single
            charge, the Ioniq 5's two battery options have ranges of up to 220
            miles (standard range, RWD) or 303/266 miles (long range, RWD/AWD).
            However, we discovered a few justifications why the Mustang Mach-E
            is a better option

      <h3 class="text-center my-3">Power</h3>
      <p class="lead">
        In terms of conventional power ratings, the Mustang Mach-E outperforms
        the Ioniq 5 by delivering more horsepower and torque in RWD variants and
        more horsepower in eAWD vehicles. Worth Noting: Buyers of the Ioniq 5
        will have a lesser horsepower rating than a comparable Mustang Mach-E
        model with a maximum range of 303 miles (RWD, long-range). With standard
        eAWD, the California Route 1 variant has a range of 312 miles(1) and 346
        horsepower, according to the EPA.2) Nothing Similar to the GT The GT
        series and GT Performance Edition of the Mustang Mach-E are both
        available, and both include a stronger secondary e-motor for maximum
        performance. There isn't a model from Ioniq 5 that can be compared to
        the GT.
      </p>
      <p class="lead">
        <span class="lead font-weight-bold">Noteable:</span>
        The Mustang Mach-E GT Performance Edition can accelerate from 0 to 60
        mph in the region of 3.5 seconds, which is another benefit. The AWD
        version of the Ioniq 5 can reach 60 mph in 5.2 seconds.

            Mustang Mach-E also has important range advantages. Customers who
            select the Select trim level, which comes with RWD and a
            standard-range battery, will have a range of 250 miles, according to
            the EPA. The range of the entry-level Ioniq 5 SE is estimated by the
            EPA to be 220 miles. The longest ranges supplied by each
            manufacturer also highlight an intriguing distinction: the Mustang
            Mach-E California Route 1 model has an EPA-estimated maximum range
            of 312 miles while simultaneously providing the advantages of
            standard all-wheel drive. The Ioniq 5 comes with special features
            like Vehicle-to-Load power, which includes exportable power and
            vehicle-to-vehicle charging, as well as the Blind Spot View Monitor,
            which shows photos of what is in the blind spot. These Ioniq 5
            features are not featured in the lower trim levels and are only
            accessible on the model with the highest trim level (Limited). Ioniq
            5 has the capacity to charge really quickly. Owners may recharge the
            battery from 10% to 80% in 18 minutes thanks to the battery's
            350-kW, 800-volt capacity. The Mustang Mach-E does not currently
            have this feature. However, the Mach-E had many additional
            advantages that will help you to choose the Mach-E. Members of the
            BlueOval Charge Network who purchase a Mustang Mach-E will receive
            250 kWh of free DC fast charging at Electrify America stations as
            well as access to more than 84,000 plugs at various charging
            stations across the nation.
